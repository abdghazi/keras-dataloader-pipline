# keras-dataloader-pipline
a keras pipeline that contains: 
1. data preproccesing(normilization, one_hot_encoding, label_encoding....)
2. date features engineering
3. saving data as h5 file 
4. saving transforers as pickle file 
5. reading from h5 file
6. creates a tabuler dataloader for fully connected netwroks 
7. create a time series dataloader for RNN networks
